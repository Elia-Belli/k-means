# K-means Parallelization Project
In this repository you will find the project for the **Multicore Programming** course @ Sapienza University of Rome.

Our job was to parallelize the given k-means algorithm and provide 4 implementations using the following technologies:
- OpenMPI
- OpenMP
- CUDA
- MPI + OpenMP

In the `docs` folder you can find the **handout** describing the sequential algorithm, and our **report** in which we describe the main points of our implementations and do an analisys of the performance for each one.
